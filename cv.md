### Briefly About Myself:
I previously trained as a business analyst, a devops engineer, but in the end I realized that I was close to working with what I could see. Even in my first year of study at Astana IT University, I liked the discipline of web development, from where I have experience with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP. I really want to get into EPAM, as I am sure that this is the place that will give me a push in the right direction for further growth as a frontend developer.
